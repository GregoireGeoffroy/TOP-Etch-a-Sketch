Responsive Dynamic Grid

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive, dynamic grid. The grid starts with a default size of 16x16 squares, which can be adjusted by the user through a button prompt. Each square changes color randomly when hovered over, creating a pixelated trail effect.
Features

- Responsive Grid: The grid dynamically adjusts to the size of the viewport while maintaining a square aspect ratio.
- Interactive Squares: Each square changes to a random color when the mouse hovers over it.
- Dynamic Resizing: Users can specify the number of squares per side, up to a maximum of 100, through a button prompt.
- Flexbox Layout: The grid layout is managed using Flexbox, ensuring a consistent and flexible design.
